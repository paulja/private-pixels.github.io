# Private Pixels
Private Pixels is a small team of developers and designers where privacy and anonymity is at the core of our work. We're hard workers and we love what we do. We have over 30 years experience in UX/UI design, software development and cloud implementations for mobile and the web. 

## Are you taking on new projects right now?
We tend to be booked for few months in advance, but don't let that stop you, we would love to hear from you: <hello@private-pixels.co.uk.>

## What is it like to work with you?
We’re a small but professional team, passionate about our work, and want you to have the best experience. You always get our best.

## Can I see what you’re doing on my project on a regular basis?
Absolutely! You’ll get regular status updates and access to the source code and assets as we create them.

## Do you use any kind of development methodology?
We have a straightforward approach: We create weekly milestones at the beginning of the project and map features into those milestones. As the project progresses, we review the milestones regularly and make adjustments if needed. We keep you involved in the process so you always know what is going on.

## Who owns what you create during our project?
You do! Before we start, we'll put a contract in place that will make it clear what our deliverables to you will be. we may use open source libraries. We also may reuse our own code and assets, but in that case you'll have a permanent irrevocable right to use or modify the code (but we retain the rights to use it again for other customers).

## What happens when you're done? Who fixes bugs?
We work with best practices and are pragmatic programmers and designer, as such we expect the assets and code we deliver to you to free from errors, and perform as intended and expected. We'll maintain the code for a reasonable amount of time and make sure that everything is working.

## What now? How much is this going to cost? When can you start?
Once we know a little more about the project, we can give you an estimate. The first step is to get in touch: <hello@private-pixels.co.uk.>
